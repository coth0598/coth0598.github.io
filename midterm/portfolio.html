        <h2> Mental Health Bot: Moodbot </h2>
        <p>After researching other bots, our main goal was to create a bot that combines easy access to resources with preventative measures to keep users' stress under control by helping them manage tasks and complete goals. </p>
            
        <p>The problem with mental health resources for college students is the lack of quality in providing usable solutions as well as the ability to mitigate stress levels which leads to an increased number of students struggling with mental health. This is a problem for college students and young adults because the long-term effects of stress and depression can be detrimental to oneâ€™s career and can even threaten life.</p>
            
         <p>Through commitment to young adults in this era of technology, this bot consolidates mental health resources for students struggling to balance their numerous responsibilities and aims to alleviate the stress that comes with them by providing guidance on prioritizing their schedule and displaying resources in an accessible and easy-to-use way.</p>
