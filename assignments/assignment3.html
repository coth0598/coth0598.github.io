            <h3 id="Phylogeny">Phylogeny</h3>
            <p>The whales are part of the largely terrestrial mammalian clade Laurasiatheria. Whales do not form a 
                clade or order; the infraorder Cetacea includes dolphins and porpoises, which are not considered whales.
                 The phylogenetic tree shows the relationships of whales and other mammals, with whale groups marked in green.
                Cetaceans are divided into two parvorders. The larger parvorder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), is characterized 
                by the presence of baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which it uses to filter plankton,
                 among others, from the water. Odontocetes (toothed whales) are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting, 
                 as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.[10] Cetaceans and artiodactyls now are classified under the 
                 order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla, which includes both whales and hippopotamuses. 
                 The hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.[11]</p>
                 <h3 id="Evolution">Evolution</h3>
                <p>Whales are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). 
                    They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split 
                    approximately 48 million years ago.[21][22] Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea 
                    approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5â€“10 million years later. What defines an 
                    archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive 
                    features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth.[23][24][25][11] 
                    Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included 
                    their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a 
                    streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils 
                    toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers 
                    (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first 
                    odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).</p>

            <h3 id="Anatomy">Anatomy</h3>
            <p>Whales have torpedo-shaped bodies with non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers,
                 non-existent external ear flaps, a large tail fin, and flat heads (with the exception of monodontids 
                 and ziphiids). Whale skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts (with the exception of monodontids and ziphiids)
                  and eyes placed on the sides of its head. Whales range in size from the 2.6-metre (8.5 ft) and 135-kilogram
                   (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 34-metre (112 ft) and 190-metric-ton (210-short-ton) blue whale. 
                   Overall, they tend to dwarf other cetartiodactyls; the blue whale is the largest creature on earth. 
                   Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. 
                   One exception is with the sperm whale, which has males larger than the females.</p>

            <h3 id="WhaleFall">Whale fall</h3>
            <p>Upon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. 
                Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich 
                assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity
                 hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents.[82]</p>
                 <p>Deterioration of whale carcasses happens though a series of three stages. Initially, 
                     moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a 
                     period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and 
                     surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans
                      and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones 
                      releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, 
                      support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for 
                      decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.[82][83]</p>

             <h3 id="Whaling">Whaling</h3>
             <p>Whaling by humans has existed since the Stone Age. Ancient whalers used harpoons to spear the bigger 
                 animals from boats out at sea.[84] People from Norway and Japan started hunting whales around 2000 B.C.[85]
                  Whales are typically hunted for their meat and blubber by aboriginal groups; they used baleen for baskets 
                  or roofing, and made tools and masks out of bones.[85] The Inuit hunted whales in the Arctic Ocean.[85] 
                  The Basques started whaling as early as the 11th century, sailing as far as Newfoundland in the 16th 
                  century in search of right whales.[86][87] 18th- and 19th-century whalers hunted whales mainly for their 
                  oil, which was used as lamp fuel and a lubricant, baleen or whalebone, which was used for items such as 
                  corsets and skirt hoops,[85] and ambergris, which was used as a fixative for perfumes. The most successful 
                  whaling nations at this time were the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States.[88]</p>
